# Machine Learning with PySpark - Distributed Computing Project ENSAE 2020

## Dataset
Data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/data  
Since our local machines are not powerful enough, we decided to limit the dataset at 5%.  

## Local Spark Setup
Driver memory option has to be changed in the **spark-defaults.conf** if executed in local environment.  
<code> spark.driver.memory = 8g </code>
